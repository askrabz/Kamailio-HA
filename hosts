# Caution: Default SSH user is defined in "ansible.cfg" file as root. Note that, You can override this for each host
# using "ansible_user" parameter. In addition, the default ssh port is defined to be 22 in "ansible.cfg"; you can
# override this using "ansible_port" parameter. In order to define a host you must use the following format:

# alias ansible_host=<addr> ansible_port=<SSH-Port> ansible_ssh_pass=<pass>

# Fore more information about Ansible inventory refer to the following link:
# https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/intro_inventory.html

# Different hosts groups are:

# 1. kamailio: Hosts that you want Ansible to install Kamailio on them.

# 2. MySQL: Host or hosts that you want to install MySQL on them.

# 3. kamailioDbCreator: One of the hosts in the kamailio group must be added to this group. It is used inside
#    "kamailio.yml" to call "kamdbctl create".

# 4. rtpproxy: Hosts that you want to install RTPProxy on them. Note that, if you want to separate Kamailio servers
#    from RTPProxy servers; first set related settings in "settings.yml", and then add your hosts here.

# 5. rtpproxyDbCreator: The host that is used to create RTPProxy's database. Only one host should be in this group.

# The default entries are added, So you can use the playbooks with Docker
